OOP Game Show App

This project is the creation of a browser-based word guessing game entitled "Phrase Hunter".  
In this project we are expected to use JS and OOP to select a random hidden phrase in which players 
attempt to guess by clicking letters on an ons reen keyboard.

JS:
    ~ Two JS classes are created with specific properties and methods.  
    
        Game class: manages the game

        Phrase class: assists with creating an array of Phrase objects.


Code Expectations:

    ~ Choose a random phrase, split the phrase into letters and put those letters onto the gameboard.
    ~ Each time the player guesses a letter, the program will compare the chosen letter with the random phrase.
      If the letter is matched to the phrase the chosen letter is displayed onscreen.
    ~ The player will continue to guess until they win or make five wrong guesses and they lose.
    ~ If player guesses correctly a WIN screen will appear - if five incorrect guesses - LOSER screen will appear.
    ~ Player is only allowed to guess a letter once and the letter will be disabled on the onscreen keyboard.
    
    Happy Coding To Me!!!
